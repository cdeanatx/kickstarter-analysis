# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
The goal of this project was to analyze previous Kickstarter campaigns in order to advise Louise as to the viability of her own campaigns.

## Findings
After conducting the aforementioned research, I have concluded that the success of Louise's campaign(s) most largely depends upon timing (of year) and monetary goal. Below are graphical representations of my findings.
